d's type is '__main__.DSX', it's a class, containing jobs, properties, header, 
  search_types, which is a list of ["JOB", "STAGE", "LINK", "STRING", "PARAMETER"]
  See in dsx-parse's code, jobs gets an appendsion of each BEGIN_DSJOB, #687
  records gets an appendsion of each BEGIN_DSRECORD, #711
  subrecords gets an appendsion of each BEGIN DSSUBRECORD, #755

d.header is a dict, 11 keys: 'begin', 'characterset', 'exportingtool', 'toolversion', 'servername', 'toolinstanceid', 'mdisversion', 'date', 'time', 'serverversion', 'end'
d.jobs is a map, 25 items: A list of 25 "__" methods, nothing of interest? d.jobs has only special variables, no function variables, no properties. Maybe jobs are in d.properties.jobs?
d.properties is a dict, 2 keys: 'jobs', 'header'

d.properties['header'] is a dict: d.properties['header']['servername'], d.properties['header']['toolinstanceid']
d.properties['jobs'] is a list. 2881 items, same as the count of BEGIN DSJOB in the DSX file.
d.properties['jobs'][0] is a dict. 48 keys. The key, raw, has all the text. The other keys break out the stuff in raw.

There are 2881 DSJOBs represented in d.properties['jobs']). 
In the first DSJOB, there are 48 keys, including raw, (so maybe 47 things from the dsx file.)
The keys of interest include identifier, oletype, name, description, jobtype. Maybe others are complex, like subrecords ?

Job oletype and job name:
print(d.properties['jobs'][0]['identifier'], d.properties['jobs'][0]['oletype'], d.properties['jobs'][0]['name'])
print(d.properties['jobs'][1]['identifier'], d.properties['jobs'][1]['oletype'], d.properties['jobs'][1]['name'])

d.properties['jobs'][0]['subrecords'] is a list, all of subrecord's neighbors are just strings.
len(d.properties['jobs'][0]['subrecords']) has 23 items. Every item in the subrecords list is a dict. Each key's value is a string, no more nested dicts or lists.
